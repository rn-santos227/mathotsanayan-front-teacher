  `This is a comprehensive feature designed to facilitate teachers in
  managing and accessing modules for their respective subjects. It
  provides essential details such as module titles, number of items per
  module, subject classifications, and , and action buttons for viewing 
  module details and test questions`,

  `The Modules Manager displays a list of all available modules, each
  clearly identified by its title. This allows teachers to quickly
  identify the module they are interested in accessing. Alongside each
  module title, teachers can find information detailing the number of test
  items contained within. This metric gives teachers an idea of the
  breadth and depth of each module's content.`,

  `Furthermore, modules are systematically categorized according to their
  respective subjects. This categorization aids teachers in quickly
  locating modules pertinent to academic disciplines, ensuring seamless
  access to relevant content.`,

  `Additionally, intuitive action buttons are provided for each listed
  module, enabling teachers to effortlessly access both the details about
  each module and the test questions within. These action buttons provide
  direct access to module details, facilitating a comprehensive
  understanding of the module’s scope and objectives. Additionally, they
  provide access to the test questions, simplifying the process of
  reviewing and exploring the content of each module in detail.`,

  `This is a user-friendly interface designed to display questions within a
  module, along with relevant images, question types, the number of stored
  predetermined correct answers, the number of options for multiple-choice
  questions, and action button for testing the questions.`,

  `Each question is presented clearly within the interface, featuring its
  text alongside any relevant accompanying images. These images are
  strategically placed alongside the question text to provide contextual
  support and enhance understanding.`,

  `Moreover, questions are categorized with their respective types (e.g.
  word problem, multiple-choice question, etc.), assisting teachers in
  understanding the question formats. Additionally, for questions with
  multiple correct answers or predefined correct responses stored in the
  system, the interface indicates the number of correct answers available.`,

  `Furthermore, in the case of multiple-choice questions, the interface
  displays the varying number of options provided, which can range from
  two to several choices depending on the question complexity.`,

  `Lastly, an “Action” button is provided for testing each question,
  enabling teachers to initiate the testing process, submit their answers,
  and verify alignment with the correct answers stored in the system.`,

  `This feature allows teachers to evaluate questions by directly
  interacting with them through the “Test” button. It enables teachers to
  input their answers to questions and subsequently verify if their
  responses align with the correct answers stored within the system.`,

  `Teachers can select a question they wish to verify from the available
  question bank. After selecting the question, teachers input their
  answers through the Test button, drawing upon their expertise and
  understanding of the subject matter. This facilitates a hands-on
  approach to assessing the effectiveness and accuracy of questions.`,

  `Upon submission of their answers, the system compares the provided
  answers against the predefined correct answers stored in the system,
  evaluating whether the teacher's response matches the expected outcome.`,

  `Depending on the alignment, immediate feedback is provided to the
  teacher. If the provided answer matches the predefined correct answer,
  the system promptly confirms its accuracy. Alternatively, if there is a
  discrepancy, the system promptly notifies the teacher. In both cases, a
  sample solution is readily provided by the system to demonstrate the
  correct answer. This feature helps teachers understand where students
  may face challenges and areas that may require further instruction or
  clarification.`,

  `This feature encompasses various essential components designed to
  provide comprehensive information and guidance for each module. It
  comprises the module title, module stage, passing rate slider, subject,
  description, objective, and instructions.`,

  `The module title gives the teacher an idea of topic covered by the
  module. Additionally, the module stage indicates the stage or level of
  the module within the subject.`,

  `The passing rate slider is a customizable slider control allowing the
  teacher to set the desired passing rate for the module, adjustable from
  0% to 100%. This feature is particularly useful for customizing
  assessments or adjusting difficulty levels based on the needs of the
  students.`,

  `Furthermore, the subject specifies the subject area to which the module
  belongs. The description provides additional information or context
  about the module.`,

  `The objective clearly defines the learning outcome or goal that students
  are expected to achieve upon completing the module. Finally, the
  instructions furnish students with guidelines on how to approach and
  respond to the module's test questions, facilitating effective
  engagement with the material.`,
