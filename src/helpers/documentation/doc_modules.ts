  `This is a comprehensive feature designed to facilitate teachers in
  managing and accessing modules for their respective subjects. It
  provides essential details such as module titles, number of items per
  module, subject classifications, and action link for viewing questions.`,

  `The Modules Manager displays a list of all available modules, each
  clearly identified by its title. This allows teachers to quickly
  identify the module they are interested in accessing. Alongside each
  module title, teachers can find information detailing the number of test
  items contained within. This metric gives teachers an idea of the
  breadth and depth of each module's content.`,

  `Furthermore, modules are systematically categorized according to their
  respective subjects. This categorization aids teachers in quickly
  locating modules pertinent to academic disciplines, ensuring seamless
  access to relevant content.`,

  `Additionally, an intuitive action button is provided for each listed
  module, enabling teachers to effortlessly access the test questions
  within. This action button includes a direct link to the test questions,
  streamlining the process of reviewing and exploring the content of each
  module in detail.`,

  `This is a user-friendly interface designed to display questions within a
  module, along with relevant images, question types, the number of stored
  predetermined correct answers, the number of options for multiple-choice
  questions, and action button for testing the questions.`,

  `Each question is presented clearly within the interface, featuring its
  text alongside any relevant accompanying images. These images are
  strategically placed alongside the question text to provide contextual
  support and enhance understanding.`,

  `Moreover, questions are categorized with their respective types (e.g.
  word problem, multiple-choice question, etc.), assisting teachers in
  understanding the question formats. Additionally, for questions with
  multiple correct answers or predefined correct responses stored in the
  system, the interface indicates the number of correct answers available.`,

  `Furthermore, in the case of multiple-choice questions, the interface
  displays the varying number of options provided, which can range from
  two to several choices depending on the question complexity.`,

  `Lastly, an “Action” button is provided for testing each question,
  enabling teachers to initiate the testing process, submit their answers,
  and verify alignment with the correct answers stored in the system.`,
