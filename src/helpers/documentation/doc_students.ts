  `This serves as a database that stores information about the student’s
  name, section, email address, and school. It authorizes teachers with a
  user-friendly interface to efficiently create, update, and delete
  students.`,

  `This feature is a search function tailored specifically for students,
  allowing teachers to filter search results according to their needs and
  preferences. This search functionality includes filters such as
  student's name, email address, school, section, or course.`,

  `This functionality allows teachers to create or add new students to the
  database. It involves providing information such as student’s name,
  course, school, section, email address, contact number, student number,
  and default password.`,

  `This functionality enables teachers to modify existing student details
  stored in the database. For example, they might need to update the
  student's name, course, school, student number, and email address.`,

  `This functionality permits teachers to remove students from the
  database. Due to the potential impact of deletion, particularly if it
  occurs inadvertently, it is common practice to seek confirmation or
  validation to ensure that the deletion is deliberate. This typically
  involves a pop-up dialogue prompting the teacher, to confirm their
  decision to delete the student. Upon confirmation, the student's record
  is then removed from the Students Manager, and any related data may be
  adjusted or deleted based on the database's configuration.`,
