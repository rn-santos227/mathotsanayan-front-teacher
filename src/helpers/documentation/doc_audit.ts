  `The Audit Logs feature gives teachers a detailed record of what they do
  in the platform, like logging in, creating courses, updating students,
  or deleting sections. This feature serves the purpose of enhancing
  transparency, accountability, and security within the platform by
  documenting teachersâ€™ activity.`,

  `Through the Audit Details features, teachers not only have the ability
  to review their activities but also can utilize the search functionality
  to refine the audit trail according to specific criteria. Through the
  input of keywords or parameters such as activity type, feature
  interaction, or timestamp, teachers can precisely target the audit
  trail, focusing on pertinent information. This search capability enables
  teachers to recognize patterns within their usage and monitor their
  engagement across various features of the platform.`,

  `Moreover, teachers are provided with the option to reset the search
  list, offering a convenient means to clear previous search filters and
  access the complete audit trail. This particular feature enhances
  flexibility and user-friendliness, facilitating seamless navigation
  through the activity history. Whether they're reviewing recent
  activities or searching into past interactions, the ability to reset the
  search list ensures a streamlined and efficient experience, authorizing
  teachers to effectively monitor their students' progress within the
  platform.`,
